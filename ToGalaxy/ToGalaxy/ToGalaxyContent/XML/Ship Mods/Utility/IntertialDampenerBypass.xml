    <Description>Inertial Dampeners come as standard on all ships, but cannot be turned off for safety reasons.  Installing a bypass allows them to be disabled, allowing for increased maneouverability.  However, the ship becomes much harder to fly, so this is a mod recommended only for confident flyers.</Description>
